# Hospital Project
This was the final project for my Computer Science I class at SU. The program simulates a hospital database. You first enter a number of patients, followed by their information. Once this information has been stated, the program asks if the patient had any surgeries or used any medications in order to add charges to their account.

Once this the information has been input by the user, a menu is presented where the options are: display the database in a formatted table, search for patient information by name, sort patient information, or add a fee to a patient's account.
